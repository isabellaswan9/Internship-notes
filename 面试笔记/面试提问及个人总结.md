Hello,every one,First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Luo SiYuan.I am from Guangzhou University . My major is Information security. 

 I really enjoy creating beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences.

I am the sort of person who work really hard to do what I love. And I also love challenging myself. 

during the school,One of the things I've been doing is developing a student management system with three companions using php(Hypertext Preprocessor),bootstrap,and jquery.

I also have over five months experience as a front end intern. In my short time there, I've already contributed to two projects and I'm developing a project which deal with billing/invoice and process approval.What I am responsible for is building a dynamic form with hundreds of fields and dealing with the interaction between these fields.

During the internship and learning process, I ‘ve met a lot about the problems and getting help from the Internet with lots of suggestions that I can try. Sometimes I find it difficult and the next day I ‘ll muster up courage to overcome it.And I see that I learn more than programming,I also learned how to interact better with other people.

And I also used to taking Java Programming course which is opend by duke university because I plan to be a full-stack developer in the future.

That’s all about myself.Thank you!
