Hello,every one.

First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. 

My name is Luo SiYuan.

I am from Guangzhou University . My major is Information security. 

I am the sort of person who work really hard to do what I love. And I also love challenging myself. 

I really enjoy creating beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences.

So During the school,One of the things I've been doing is developing a student management system with three companions using php,bootstrap,and jquery.

I also have over five months experience as a front end intern. In my short time there, I've already contributed to two projects .

and I'm developing a project which deal with billing,invoice and process approval.What **I**'m responsible for is building a dynamic form with hundreds of fields and dealing with the interaction between these fields.

During the internship and learning process, I ‘ve met a lot about the problems and getting help from the Internet with lots of suggestions that I can try. Sometimes I find it difficult and the next day I ‘ll muster up courage to overcome it.And I see that I learn more than programming,I also learned how to interact better with other people.

That’s all about myself.Thank you!



问题解决能力的例子:

最近做的一个pbi

有多种场景的,不同region会有不同的field,同时根据不同选项有不同的计算方式

并且需要做到兄弟组件之间的交互

将一个大的问题分解成多个小问题,从小问题入手

对于没有遇到过的实现方式,

先是理清楚结果,及达到结果的条件,

现有的知识无法解决的话会查找 stack overflow因为也许大部分问题前人已经遇到过了,调整代码,调试,反复其过程

实在不行会请教其他人.

A pbi I made recently

There are many scenarios, different regions will have different fields, and there are different calculation methods according to different options.

And it is necessary to interact between brother components.

Break down a big problem into multiple small problems, starting with small problems.

For implementation methods that have not been encountered,

First, clarify the results and the conditions for achieving the results.

If the existing knowledge cannot be solved, the stack overflow will be found, because perhaps most of the problems have been encountered by predecessors, adjusting the code, debugging, and repeating the process.

If it really doesn't work, I will consult others.



个人的优缺点

1. 接受新知识的速度很快,知识联想的能力变强了,会见新的知识和旧知识联系在一起
2. 工作认真负责,问题处理的不错,曾多次收到pm的表扬,并且可以和他人合作完成任务,
3. 遇到难题,绝不放弃的精神,对于一个新问题,会不停的去想解决方案
4. The speed of accepting new knowledge is very fast, and the ability to associate knowledge has become stronger. Meeting new knowledge and old knowledge are linked.
5. Work conscientiously and responsibly, handle problems well, have received praise from pm many times, and can cooperate with others to complete the task.

6. If you encounter a difficult problem, you will never give up the spirit. For a new problem, you will keep thinking about solutions.

缺点

需要更多的工作经验,不然会因为一些知识盲区花费较多的处理时间

I need More work experience, because there are some knowledge blind spots that i don't know,for the new problem need more processing time.

专业上的优势
1.英文文档阅读能力强，曾完成五门java纯英文课程以及，一门Mean application课程（可继续解释完成的项目），
实习公司属于外企，阅读英文文档机会多
