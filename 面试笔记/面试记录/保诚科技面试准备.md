## 自我介绍

Hello,every one.

First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. 

My name is Luo SiYuan.

I am from Guangzhou University . My major is Information security. 

I am the sort of person who work really hard to do what I love. And I also love challenging myself. 

I really enjoy creating beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences.

So During the school,One of the things I've been doing is developing a student management system with three companions using php,bootstrap,and jquery.

I also have over five months experience as a front end intern. In my short time there, I've already contributed to two projects .

and I'm developing a project which deal with billing,invoice and process approval.What **I**'m responsible for is building a dynamic form with hundreds of fields and dealing with the interaction between these fields.

During the internship and learning process, I ‘ve met a lot about the problems and getting help from the Internet with lots of suggestions that I can try. Sometimes I find it difficult and the next day I ‘ll muster up courage to overcome it.And I see that I learn more than programming,I also learned how to interact better with other people.

And I also used to taking Java Programming course which is opend by duke university because I plan to be a full-stack developer in the future.

That’s all about myself.Thank you!

### 对公司的了解/为什么进入该公司

我认为前端作为一个技术工具 要产生价值就需要和实际的问题相结合 做出一个完整的产品 去服务用户 我的目标就是可以利用我所学到的技术做出用户体验良好的有价值的产品 而保诚科技就是一个开发数字化产品的金融科技公司.

我非常喜欢贵公司平等/开放/坦诚/尊重的企业文化,且贵公司鼓励工作生活平衡的理念和我的想法相契合.

I think that in order to generate value as a technical tool, the front end needs to be combined with practical problems to make a complete product to serve users. My goal is to use the technology I have learned to make valuable products with a good user experience. Prudential is a financial technology company that develops digital products.

I like your corporate culture of equality / openness / honesty / respect very much, and your idea of encouraging work-life balance is consistent with mine.

### 有什么问题?

我去看到了你们的官网,有一个pulse by prudential的app,是你们完成的吗?

我认为这个app非常cool,一想到能够在这样关注人们健康的公司工作,我会觉得非常兴奋,我很喜欢公司理念,认为做这样的事情非常有意义.

I think this app is very cool. I feel very excited at the thought of working in such a company that pays attention to people's health. I like your company philosophy very much and think it is very meaningful to do such a thing.

如果入职,我会参与到什么项目中?

What project will I be involved in if I join the team?

### 问题解决能力的例子:

#### 最近做的一个PBI(Product Backlog Item)

有多种场景的,不同region会有不同form,不同的form会有field之间的差异,同时根据不同选项有不同的计算方式,并且需要做到兄弟组件之间的交互

如果使用html去创建表单,代码会变得冗余并且难以维护,所以就将其设计成可配置的动态表单

##### 解决方案:

1. 将一个大的问题分解成多个小问题,从小问题入手

2. 对于没有遇到过的实现方式,

先是理清楚结果,及达到结果的条件,

现有的知识无法解决的话会查找 stack overflow因为也许大部分问题前人已经遇到过了,调整代码,调试,反复其过程

实在不行会请教其他人.

#### A Product Backlog Item I made recently

There are many scenarios.

Our system has a lot of regions. Different region will have different form, and different form will have differences between field., There are some computational interactions between fields.(and there are different calculation methods according to different options.)

And it is necessary to interact between brother components.

If we use html to create every form, the code will become redundant(/*rɪ'dʌndənt*/) and difficult to maintain, so it is designed as a configurable dynamic form.

##### My solution is

first ,Breaking down a big problem into multiple small problems, starting with these small problems.

For problems that i have never been encountered before

First,i would clarify the results and the conditions for achieving the results.

If the existing knowledge cannot solve it,i will found solution in the internet like stack overflow ,because perhaps most of the problems have been encountered by predecessors(/*predəsesər*/), 

then adjusting the code, debugging, and repeating the process.

If it really doesn't work, I will consult with others.

## 个人的优缺点

### 优点 (strengths)

1. #### 接受新知识的速度很快,知识联想的能力变强了,会见新的知识和旧知识联系在一起

   I have a very systematic self-learning method.

   my speed of accepting new knowledge is very fast, and in the learning process my ability to associate knowledge has become stronger. it means when i encounter new knowledge i will associate it with what i already know

   学习一门新语言/框架的方法

   首先，确保自己学这个东西的基础知识，一般官方的文档会提供，然后根据官方文档，完成一个小的应用，理解里面的概念

   把这些概念用自己的语言说出来

   之后，开始着手于自己想通过这个语言实现的东西，先给自己布置小的任务，去认识项目的其中一个模块,不停的联系自己已经学到的知识,以方便理解和记忆

   通过不断的练习,来掌握这个语言

   ##### examples:

   there is a case that how i learn a front end framework Angular

   before i came into my intership company i just learn vue and react never use the framework angular

   i spend one week to read the official document and create a small app following the document to grasp the brand new syntax for me

   i also find that there are many same concepts  between these three framework, although the syntax is different so it can help me understand these syntax and remerber them.

   (tips:finding the connections between the new knowledge and what i already know.)

   After that, start to work on what i want to achieve through this language.I assign some small task to understand one of the modules of the project, and keep contacting what you have learned to facilitate understanding and memory.

   Master it through constant practice

2. 工作认真负责,问题处理的不错,曾多次收到pm的表扬,并且可以和他人合作完成任务,

   i can Work conscientiously and responsibly, handle problems well, have received praise from pm many times, and can cooperate with others to complete the task.

3. 遇到难题,绝不放弃的精神,对于一个新问题,会不停的去想解决方案

   If you encounter a difficult problem, you will never give up the spirit. For a new problem, you will keep thinking about solutions.

### 缺点(weakness)

1. 需要更多的工作经验,不然会因为一些知识盲区花费较多的处理时间

   I need More work experience, because sometimes there are some knowledge blind spots that i don't know,cause that i need more processing time to solve a new problem

2. 害怕直面自己的失败,在面对挑战的时候会非常紧张,然后挑战失败的时候会沮丧,以至于难以平静下来去解决问题,找到失败的原因

   不过随着一次次的挑战,我逐渐明白了,不要去想结果会如何,而是在这个过程中的收获

   Afraid to face your own failure, you will be very nervous when facing the challenge, and then you will be depressed when the challenge fails, so that it is difficult to calm down to solve the problem and find the reason for the failure.
   However, with the challenges over and over again, I have come to understand that don't think about what the result will be, but what you will gain in the process.

### 前端是做什么的?

作为一名前端软件工程师，您将负责设计、开发和交付可用的、适应性强的、可靠的和安全的业务前端应用程序，为区域业务增长做出贡献。您将应用最新的敏捷开发方法和流程来快速、高质量地交付软件。你将在一个充满活力的项目团队中工作，在类似于初创企业的环境中为我们的数字计划的成功做出贡献。你应该具备出色的沟通和文档能力。

As a front-end software engineer, you will be responsible for designing, developing, and delivering available, adaptable, reliable, and secure business front-end applications that contribute to regional business growth. You will apply the latest agile development methods and processes to deliver software quickly and with high quality. You will work in a dynamic project team and contribute to the success of our digital program in an environment similar to that of a start-up. You should have excellent communication and documentation skills.

### 为什么选择前端?

当我用自己学到的技术创造出一个界面的时候会觉得非常有成就感,我会完全沉浸在这个过程中

When I use the technology I have learned to create a product, I will feel a great sense of achievement, and I will be completely immersed in the process.

### 如何和后端的协作的?

1. 评审需求是否合理,需要花费多少工时,确定任务优先级,确定前后端的工作边界

   Review whether the requirements are reasonable, confirm how many man-hours need to be spent, determine the priority(/*praɪ'ɔːrətɪ*/) of the task, and determine the work boundary of the front end and back end

2. 确定api,mock数据,并行开发,进行接口的连调

   Determine the api,mock data, develop in parallel(/*pærəlel*/), and adjust the interface continuously(/*kənˈtɪnjʊəsli*/).

3. 开发完成会进行自测,发布给测试

   After finishing the development, the self-test will be carried out and then released to the test.

### 专业上的优势

1. 我的专业英文文档阅读能力强，曾完成五门java英文课程以及，一门Mean application课程（可继续解释完成的项目），
   实习公司是外企，完成国际的大型商用系统.工作时我们会阅读纯英文的需求文档,以完成开发,但我们用中文沟通
   遇到问题时我也会查看英文文档,我也会浏览一些关于技术的英文博客
   空余时间我会练习听力和口语 

   I have a good ability to read professional English documents. I have completed five java English courses and one Mean application course
   The internship company is a foreign company that completes large-scale international commercial systems. When we work, we will read the English requirement documents  to complete the development, but we communicate in Chinese.
   When I encounter problems, I will also check English documents, and I will also browse some English blogs about technology.
   I will practice listening and speaking in my spare time.

### 为什么想成为一个全栈工程师?

因为我想拥有创造一个完整的产品 实现自己想法的能力 ,我想了解一个产品的方方面面,不仅仅是前端,所以我想成为一个全栈工程师 

业余我也会去学习全栈所需要具备的知识

Because I want to have the ability to create a complete product to realize my ideas, I want to know all aspects of a product, not just the front end, so I want to be a full stack engineer. 
In my spare time, I will also learn the knowledge needed for the full stack.

### 和领导有冲突怎么办

有冲突是因为对方不理解我的想法,而我也不了解对方的决策,我们之间缺少对同一个问题的沟通,我认为这时就去主动沟通,了解对方的想法和我的想法有什么区别,然后再找到这其中的一个平衡点

I think there is a conflict because the other party does not understand my ideas, and I do not understand each other's decisions, and there is a lack of communication between us on the same issue. I think we should take the initiative to communicate at this time to understand the difference between each other's ideas and mine, and then find a balance.

我发现在实习公司工作时,就会出现 pm和开发者对同一个需求的设计会有些不同,那这时我们就互相商量,选择最有利于产品的那个方案

I find that when I work in my internship company, there will be some differences in the design of pm and developers for the same requirements, so we discuss with each other and choose the solution that is most beneficial to the product.

代码审查

### 小组合作的例子

我在这个账单处理系统中,担任的是前端实习生的工作,我会配合组长高效的完成工作,当我对需求文档有疑问时,我会及时询问需求工程师,同时也会和测试工程师沟通,处理一些程序的bug

when I work as a front-end intern in this bill processing system. I will cooperate with the team leader to finish the work efficiently. When I have questions about the requirements documents, I will ask the requirements engineers in time. At the same time, I will also communicate with the test engineers to deal with the bug of some programs.

### 遇到没听懂的问题时

1. i wanna make sure that i understand perfectly.Can you please repeat or clarify the question?

   

2. I'm sorry, I don't understand that question. Could you repeat that, please?

3. That‘s a great question.Could you please give me a moment to think about it?

4. if this situation happens,I would firstly do,and then I would ,and lastly

五、java课程

This course consists of five courses, which will teach us to use java to write some algorithms to solve practical problems.

对DNA序列进行处理，找出起始密码子和终止密码子，并且中间部分是三的倍数，计算

使用开源Apache Commons CSV插件对csv天气数据进行批量处理，如寻找一年中最热或最冷的一天，湿度，平均气温等

对一个网站的日志文件进行分析，计算网站的被浏览量，一天内有多少个不同的IP浏览，以及不同IP浏览的次数，目的是可以观测到网站的数据可以得到反馈更好的管理网站。

统计婴儿的名字，不同年份对应的同一排名的名字。一个名字在多个年份中的平均排名，

实现凯撒密码，根据加密密钥将字母表向前移几位，解密用密钥26-key、暴力破解、寻找最多的字母将它当作e得出密钥。更进一步的是不同位置的字符使用不同的密钥加密。

实现Vigenere加密算法，采用一个单词作为密钥，不同位置的字符使用不同的字母加密，已知语言和秘钥长度的解密，已知语言未知密钥的解密（尝试1到100的长度，解密后对比字典，拥有最多有效词的的是解密结果），未知语言未知密钥的解密（找出不同语言中的最常见字母，将其作为密钥的出口，之后的解密方式差不多，最后对比有效词即可），

The DNA sequence is processed to find out the start codon and the stop codon, and the middle part is a multiple of three.

Use the open source Apache Commons CSV plug-in to batch process csv weather data, such as finding the hottest or coldest day of the year, humidity, average temperature, etc.

Analyze the log files of a website, calculate the number of views of the website, how many different IP views there are in a day, and the number of times of different IP browsing, in order to observe the data of the website and get feedback to better manage the website.

Count the names of babies and the names of the same rankings corresponding to different years. The average ranking of a name over multiple years.

To implement the Caesar cipher, move the alphabet forward several bits according to the encryption key, decrypt it with the key 26-key, crack it violently, and find the most letters to get the key as e. Further, characters in different locations are encrypted with different keys.

To implement the Vigenere encryption algorithm, one word is used as the key, characters in different locations are encrypted with different letters, the length of the known language and the secret key is decrypted, the unknown key of the known language is decrypted (try the length of 1 to 100, compare the dictionary after decryption, the one with the most valid words is the decryption result), the decryption of the unknown key of the unknown language (find out the most common letters in different languages and use it as the exit of the key. After that, the decryption method is similar, and finally you can compare the valid words.)
